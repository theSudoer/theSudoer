Aspiring cybersecurity professional and proactive student based in the UK. I specialise in threat modelling, secure system design, and ethical tech education. My journey spans hands-on experience with tools like Wireshark, Nmap, and Metasploit, scripting in Python and PowerShell, and leading community-driven cybersecurity initiatives.
Currently pursuing a BSc in Applied Cyber Security, I’ve led helpdesk teams, built secure login systems. I’m passionate about privacy, digital resilience, and scalable security solutions.
